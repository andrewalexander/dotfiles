## Pre-requisite for Mac

Install Firefox

Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install git and clone this repo

```
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh | sh
eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
brew install git
git clone https://github.com/andrewalexander/dotfiles
```

Install [alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) or [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/index.html) for terminal

## Installation
```
# make init # for linux
make init-mac # for mac
make install
make plugins
```

## Trackpad scroll direction
For some reason the magic trackpad didn't respect the settings in the UI. Adding this to `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-touchpad.conf` made it work and persist

```
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "touchpad"
    Driver "libinput"
    MatchIsTouchpad "on"
    Option "Tapping" "on"
    Option "NaturalScrolling" "false"
EndSection
```

## Notes
Uses the arch gvim package even for vim so that it gets compiled with `+clipboard` and can use the system clipboard which alacritty is also configured to share.

Uses stow to create symlinks of everything in `config/` to `~/`

## Further customization for mac
System Settings we can't necessarily automate (or can we? ðŸ¤”). We usually won't have to do this unless it's a brand new mac or a truly fresh install. 

Even if a Security Response breaks our install on an out of support mac, we can always re-install the OS using our recovery drive via the OpenCore Legacy Patcher [USB Boot Drive](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/BOOT.html) we will keep around (or create in a pinch).
- it is unclear if re-installing macos via the recovery partition will install the last officially supported macOS version apple released for the hardware or if it will use the version installed with Open Core Legacy Patcher. Rather than find out the last time around, I just used the USB drive to do a clean Mojave install (Disk Utiliy -> Erase Macintosh HD before installing Mojave).
